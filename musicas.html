    I'm an alien<br>
    'Cause I'm not of this world,<br>
    I have a name<br>
    but I've been changed, and now I can't stay the same<br>
    and I'm a loser if that means I've been lost before<br>
    but now I found it, I'm surrounded<br>
    'Cause you can hear the way it sounded<br>
    Like angels singing with a million voices<br>
    The end is where we begin<br>
    It's crawling back when<br>
    We run away, run away<br>
    'Cause the end is where we begin<br>
    Where broken hearts mend<br>
    and start to beat again<br>
    The end is where we begin<br>
    I'm a monster if that means I'm misunderstood<br>
    'Cause its alive and I can't hide it<br>
    The energy is rising<br>
    and I'm a traitor if that means I've turned on myself<br>
    I can't deny it, it's like a riot<br>
    and I can't keep it quiet<br>
    Like angels singing with a million voices<br>
    The end is where we begin<br>
    It's crawling back when<br>
    We run away, run away<br>
    'Cause the end is where we begin<br>
    Where broken hearts mend<br>
    and start to beat again<br>
    The end is where we begin<br>
    Hear me running<br>
    Hear me running, running<br>
    Hear me running, hear me running, ra-running<br>
    Hear me running, hear me<br>
    The end is where we begin<br>
    It's crawling back when<br>
    We run away, run away<br>
    'Cause the end is where we begin<br>
    Where broken hearts mend<br>
    and start to beat again<br>
    The end is where we begin<br>
    It's crawling back when<br>
    We run away, run away<br>
    'Cause the end is where we begin<br>
    Where broken hearts mend<br>
    and start to beat again<br>
    The end is where we begin<br>

    You call me out upon the waters<br>
    The great unknown where feet may fail<br>
    And there I find You in the mystery<br>
    In oceans deep my faith will stand<br>
    And I will call upon Your Name<br>
    And keep my eyes above the waves<br>
    When oceans rise<br>
    My soul will rest in Your embrace<br>
    For I am Yours and You are mine<br>
    Your grace abounds in deepest waters<br>
    Your sovereign hand will be my guide<br>
    Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me<br>
    You've never failed and You won't start now<br>
    So I will call upon Your Name<br>
    And keep my eyes above the waves<br>
    When oceans rise<br>
    My soul will rest in Your embrace<br>
    For I am Yours and You are mine<br>
    And You are mine<br>
    Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders<br>
    Let me walk upon the waters<br>
    Wherever You would call me<br>
    Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander<br>
    And my faith will be made stronger<br>
    In the presence of my Saviour<br>
    Sirit lead me where my trust is without borders<br>
